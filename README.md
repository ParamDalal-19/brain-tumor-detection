# Brain Tumor Detection

This project focuses on the detection of brain tumors in medical images using image processing and segmentation techniques. It provides a MATLAB implementation that takes a brain image as input and identifies the presence of a tumor, producing an output image with the tumor region highlighted.

## Project Overview

The brain tumor detection project utilizes the following steps:

1. Image Thresholding: The input brain image is converted into a binary image using a thresholding technique to separate the foreground (tumor) from the background.

2. Region Labeling and Analysis: Connected components in the binary image are labeled, and statistical properties such as solidity and area are computed for each labeled region.

3. Tumor Detection: Regions with high solidity above a specified threshold are identified as potential tumor regions. The largest region based on area is considered the tumor, and a binary image is created to isolate it.

4. Tumor Region Enhancement: Morphological dilation is performed on the tumor image to enhance and refine the tumor region.

5. Result Visualization: The project provides visualizations of the original brain image, the isolated tumor region, and the boundaries of the detected tumor.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
```

2. Install MATLAB and ensure the required dependencies are installed.

3. Place the brain images you want to analyze in the project directory.

4. Open the MATLAB script tumor_detection.m and modify the code as needed, such as adjusting threshold values or filenames.

5. Run the MATLAB script to perform the brain tumor detection on the input images.

## Dataset

The project does not include a specific dataset. Users are expected to provide their own brain images for analysis.
